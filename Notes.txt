NEXT JS


What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications with better performance, SEO, and developer experience.

It extends React by adding features like:

✅ File-based Routing
✅ Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
✅ Static Site Generation (SSG)
✅ API Routes
✅ Image Optimization
✅ Middleware & Server Actions

Difference Between React.js and Next.js

| Feature          | React.js                                   | Next.js                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Type**         | JavaScript library for UI                  | Full-stack React framework          |
| **Rendering**    | Client-side only                           | Server-side, Static, or Client-side |
| **Routing**      | Manual using `react-router-dom`            | File-based routing (built-in)       |
| **SEO**          | Poor (since content loads on client)       | Excellent (server-rendered pages)   |
| **Setup**        | Needs config for routing, SSR, etc.        | Comes pre-configured                |
| **Performance**  | Slower initial load                        | Faster with pre-rendering           |
| **API Handling** | Needs separate backend (like Node/Express) | Built-in API routes                 |
| **Deployment**   | Manual setup                               | Easy deployment (Vercel, etc.)      |
